## ⚠️ Issues & Risks

- Slight delay in frontend resource tree view completion.
- Realization that network planning could’ve been done in Gantt—small inefficiency.

## 📌 Notes & Next Steps

- Continue with project calculation (AWL)
- Begin development of Benutzerhandbuch (User Manual)
- Implement rights and permissions management
- Complete resource integration into frontend tree
- Finalize delete/tag logic in file menu
